###### FOR IX TO TRY (thank you, Ix)
## The correct answer from the function should be 11, since Mason Plumlee
## has the largest shoe size (at 19) and is the only one with 11 rebounds

## The version that works
def big_shoe_rebounds
  player_with_biggest_shoe = all_players.max{ |a, b| a[:shoe] <=> b[:shoe] }
  player_with_biggest_shoe[:rebounds]
end

## The version that doesn't work for some reason...
# def big_shoe_rebounds
#   player_with_biggest_shoe = all_players.max{ |a| a[:shoe] }
#   player_with_biggest_shoe[:rebounds]
# end
